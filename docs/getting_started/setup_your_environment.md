## Setup your environment

To productively get going with Deno you should set up your environment. This
means setting up shell autocomplete, environmental variables and your editor or
IDE of choice.

### Environmental variables

There are several env vars that control how Deno behaves:

`DENO_DIR` defaults to `$HOME/.cache/deno` but can be set to any path to control
where generated and cached source code is written and read to.

`NO_COLOR` will turn off color output if set. See https://no-color.org/. User
code can test if `NO_COLOR` was set without having `--allow-env` by using the
boolean constant `Deno.noColor`.

### Shell autocomplete

You can generate completion script for your shell using the
`deno completions <shell>` command. The command outputs to stdout so you should
redirect it to an appropriate file.

The supported shells are:

- zsh
- bash
- fish
- powershell
- elvish

Example:

```shell
deno completions bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/deno.bash
source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/deno.bash
```

### Editors and IDEs

Because Deno requires the use of file extensions for module imports and allows
http imports, and most editors and language servers do not natively support this
at the moment, many editors will throw errors about being unable to find files
or imports having unnecessary file extensions.

The community has developed extensions for some editors to solve these issues:

#### VS Code

The beta version of [vscode_deno](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno) is
published on the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno).
Please report any issues.

#### JetBrains IDEs

Support for JetBrains IDEs is available through
[the Deno plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14382-deno).

For more information on how to set-up your JetBrains IDE for Deno, read
[this comment](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-41607#focus=streamItem-27-4160152.0-0)
on YouTrack.

#### Vim and NeoVim

Vim works fairly well for Deno/TypeScript if you install
[CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) (intellisense engine and language
server protocol). After CoC itself is installed, from inside Vim, simply run
`:CocInstall coc-deno`. From now on, things like `gd` (go to definition) and
`gr` (goto/find references) should work.

#### Emacs

Emacs works pretty well for a TypeScript project targeted to Deno by using
a combination of [tide](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide) which is the
canonical way of using TypeScript within Emacs and 
[typescript-deno-plugin](https://github.com/justjavac/typescript-deno-plugin)
which is what is used by the 
[official VSCode extensions for Deno](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno).

To use it, first make sure that `tide` is setup for your instance of Emacs.
Next, as instructed on the 
[typescript-deno-plugin](https://github.com/justjavac/typescript-deno-plugin)
page first `npm install --save-dev typescript-deno-plugin typescript` in your 
project (`npm init -y` as necessary), then add the following block to your
`tsconfig.json` and you are off to the races!

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "typescript-deno-plugin",
        "enable": true, // default is `true`
        "importmap": "import_map.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you don't see your favorite IDE on this list, maybe you can develop an
extension. Our [community Discord group](https://discord.gg/TGMHGv6) can give
you some pointers on where to get started.
